Thanks for stopping by. The Crystal Collector Game is an interactive web game where you try to match the a randomly generated number. 

1. A number is displayed. 
2. You begin by clicking on the crystals, which have a hidden value that remains the same through out the duration of the game. You are able to click the crystals as many times as you need in order to match the number. 
3. If you match the number, you win! 
4. If you exceed the number, you lose. 
5. The game will restart when you either win or lose. 

Test your memory and good luck!
